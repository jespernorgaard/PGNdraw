# Introduction

The PGNdraw program can be used to visualize in PGN (Portable Game Notation) files at which moves in the chess game a draw could be claimed, and by whom. You use the program selecting a specific PGN file you want analyzed, and then the program produces a new PGN file with only those games in which a draw could be claimed and opens it in Wordpad. This file can then be saved as a new PGN file. If you open it in a suitable program to show the games and the new comments inserted, you can click on each new comment inserted, which will usually show you the position in a board window. This is what happens when using the Tarrasch program.
